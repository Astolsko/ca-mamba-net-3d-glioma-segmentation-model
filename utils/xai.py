    Classification Grad-CAM differentiates a single class logit. Segmentation
    has one logit per voxel, so following Seg-Grad-CAM (Vinogradova et al.,
    AAAI 2020) the score is the SUM of the class logits over a region of
    interest M:

        S_c = sum_{v in M} logit_c(v)

    The ROI matters. With M = the whole volume the score is dominated by the
    ~99% of voxels that are background, and the resulting map explains "where
    is brain", not "why this tumour". M is normally the ground-truth region of
    class c (cfg.xai.cam_roi = "gt") or the model's own prediction ("pred").

    Two aggregations, both computed from the same forward/backward pass:

      grad  — classic Grad-CAM. Pool each channel's gradient to a scalar
              weight, w_k = mean_v dS/dA_k(v), then cam = relu(sum_k w_k A_k).
      hires — HiResCAM. Keep the gradient elementwise:
              cam = relu(sum_k dS/dA_k .* A_k).
              Provably reflects the voxels the model actually used; Grad-CAM's
              pooling step can move mass onto regions that did not contribute.

    Used as a context manager so the forward hook is always removed.

    Randomise the decoder from the output backwards, recomputing the CAM after
    each step, and measure SSIM against the map from the trained model. A
    faithful attribution must decay towards noise. If it does NOT — if the map
    survives having the weights destroyed — then the method is responding to
    image structure, i.e. it is an edge detector wearing an explanation's
    clothes, and every conclusion drawn from it is void.

    This is the cheapest way to pre-empt the most common reviewer objection to
    a saliency-based XAI section, and it is the one experiment that can
    invalidate the rest.

    Mutates the model, so callers must reload the checkpoint afterwards.
